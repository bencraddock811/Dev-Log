# Markdown Language

## What is Markdown?

The [IMB website](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSYKAV?topic=train-how-do-use-markdown), to which I will be reffering, describes mark down as "an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without the use of a formal text editor or the use of HTML tags". For my purposes this means being able to format notes and create accessible and organised notes and READMEs to refer back to and explain my journey and projects.

## Markdown Syntax

Mardown simplfies sytax from HTML. For example, where in HTML a h1 would be entered as `<h1>Text</h1>`, in markdown, the correct sytax would be `#Text`.

<!-- Code entered to display as code should be enclosed within backticks `code` for inline code and triple backticks ```Code Block``` for a code block -->

### Following is a list of useful syntax for markdown to refer to:

* **Headings:**
    * `#`: Heading 1
    * `##`: Heading 2
    * `######`: Heading 6
* **Emphasis**
    * `*Text*`: Italic
    * `**Text**`: Bold
* **Strikethrough**
    * `~~Text~~`: Strikethrough
* **Hyperlinks**
    * `[Link Text](URL)`: Link
    * `![Alt Text](URL "Title")`: Image
* **Table**
    * This is the formatted table:
      |Heading|Heading|Heading|
      |-------|:-----:|------:|
      |Col 1  |Left   |Aligned|
      |Col 2  |Center |Aligned|
      |Col 3  |Right  |Aligned|
    * This is the raw code:
        ```
      |Heading|Heading|Heading|
      |-------|:-----:|------:|
      |Col 1  |Left   |Aligned|
      |Col 2  |Center |Aligned|
      |Col 3  |Right  |Aligned|
        ```
